# MSc_Thesis-Classify-Objects-Using-bigger-NN
This is a part of my Thesis "Curve Recognition and Object Classification using Artificial Intelligence Methods". At this step we classify the objects using the curvature and Neural Networks. Every NN represents a whole image or an image group. This is Matlab code. You can find my Thesis at this link : http://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/299139/?ln=en
